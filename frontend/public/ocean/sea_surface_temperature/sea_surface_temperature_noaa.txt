    "description": "This dataset showcases variations in global sea surface temperatures over several years, highlighting the effects of seasonal cycles, surface ocean currents, and eddies that transport heat and water across the globe. The dataset is generated from NOAA's GFDL state-of-the-art climate model, providing a simulated view of SST patterns rather than observations.",
